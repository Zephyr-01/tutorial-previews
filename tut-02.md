# Tutorial 01: Skills from Labs 8.11 - 8.20

**2021-09-24 (F)**

To get a Perk:

- **you must be given the OK by JP before the end of your tutorial, AND**
- **your submitted work must do what it is supposed to do, AND**
- **your submitted work must be valid HTML/CSS/JS, AND**
- **you must submit your work by 9PM (401) / 10PM (402) the day of your tutorial.**

## Overview

The second milestone for the first assignment is a-comin', so we've gotta make sure you've got the basics of JS outta the way.

## Time Limit

JP will start circulating and checking work 20 minutes into the tutorial.

## Prep to make your life a bit easier

By doing the following work ahead of time, you will make your time in tutorial more effective. Yay?

- go to http://imdb.com, find a movie you like, and take note of the following things:
  1. the title
  2. the year released
  3. the names and positions (like gaffer, grip, cinematographer, etc.) of two or three **crew** members from the film
- go to https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/overview and grab the following information for 3 planets in our Solar System that are NOT Earth:
  1. name
  2. distance from the sun in AU
  3. a link to the URL for that planet's Overview page
  4. an array containing the atmospheric constituents of the planet as good ole strings. You can find this info in the By The Numbers section of that planet. If no such section exists for your chosen planet, the array should be empty. (I'm looking at **you**, Mercury.)
  5. an object containing the planet's equatorial radius (in km) and equatorial inclination (in degrees). You can also find this info in the By The Numbers section.

## Skills Checked

I want to see that you can:

- [ ] declare and initialize an array
- [ ] retrieve elements of an array using `[]` notation
- [ ] find the length of an array
- [ ] iterate through an array using a traditional for loop
- [ ] iterate through an array using a for-of loop
- [ ] declare and initialize a JS object using an object literal
- [ ] access object properties using dot notation and/or square bracket notation
- [ ] create a function (perhaps with parameters) via a function declaration
- [ ] call a JS function with no arguments
- [ ] call a JS function with primitive arguments
- [ ] call a JS function with a function argument
- [ ] create a constructor function
- [ ] create a JS object using a constructor function

## Prerequisites

I'm assuming that you've:

- [ ] completed all the prerequisites from previous tutorials
- [ ] worked through labs 8.11 through 8.20 (or have acquired the necessary skills through some other means)
